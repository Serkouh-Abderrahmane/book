# Architecture

A tour of how Nestoria is laid out, why the pieces are split the way they are, and what flows through them at runtime.

```

The frontend never touches the database or storage directly. The backend never serves HTML — it is a pure JSON API.

```

### Why feature folders?

The previous codebase had one fat controller per entity in `controllers/` and a sibling route file in `routes/`, plus duplicated logic across Customer and Host. Splitting into feature folders means:

- A new contributor opens one folder to see everything about, say, bookings.
- Each module's route file owns its own middleware stack (`router.use(authenticate, requireHost)`), so the global wiring stays trivial.
- Cross-cutting helpers live in `lib/` and `middleware/` — never inside a module.

### The generic `userRepo`

The product keeps Customer and Host as separate SQL tables (different columns, different ratings semantics) but the **behaviour** is almost identical: lookup by id, lookup by email, lookup by `google_sub`, create, update, set password, link Google account.

`lib/userRepo.js` exposes a single factory:

```js
const customers = userRepo('customer');
const hosts     = userRepo('host');

await customers.getByEmail('anaya@example.com');
await hosts.create({ email, password_hash, full_name, business_name });
```

It internally holds an allow-list of writable columns per role to prevent drive-by updates from a request body. The 80% of duplicated controller code from the previous version collapses into ~80 LOC of repo + 3 short functions per controller.

### Error flow

Every controller is wrapped in `asyncHandler` (see `lib/http.js`). Anything thrown — domain errors via `badRequest('…')`, `notFound('…')`, etc., or runtime errors — bubbles up to `middleware/error.js`, which sends a JSON envelope:

```json
{ "error": "Hotel not found", "code": "notFound" }
```

No controller writes `try/catch` boilerplate.

```

### Data fetching pattern

Every screen pulls server data through TanStack Query, never via `useEffect + fetch`:

```jsx
const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['hotel', slug],
  queryFn: () => hotelsAPI.detail(slug).then((d) => d.hotel),
});
```

Mutations (create booking, cancel booking, save profile) go through `useMutation` with `onSuccess` invalidating the relevant query keys.

Benefits over the previous `useState + useEffect` style:
- Automatic request deduplication.
- Cache survives navigation — clicking back to a detail screen renders instantly while a background refetch runs.
- Built-in `isLoading` / `isError` / `isFetching` states.

### Reusable overlay + map primitives

Two small components encapsulate patterns that recur across the app:

- **`Popover.jsx`** — renders children into a `document.body` portal, positions itself with `position: fixed` from an anchor ref's `getBoundingClientRect()`, re-positions on `scroll`/`resize`, and handles outside-click + Escape. Used by the SearchBar's Where / Dates / Guests popovers; the same primitive will host future inline overlays.
- **`HotelMap.jsx`** — wraps Leaflet + OSM tiles. In read-only mode it renders a fixed marker for the customer detail screen. In interactive mode it accepts an `onChange({ lat, lng })` callback for the host's location-picker step.

### Saved-hotels (favourites) flow

Hearts everywhere (HomeScreen / HotelsScreen / DetailScreen) route through the **`useSavedHotels`** hook. The hook is TanStack-backed:

- A single `useQuery(['saved'])` fetches `/api/profile/saved` on mount; cached for 60 s.
- `toggle(id)` issues a `POST` or `DELETE` and **optimistically** updates the cache before the request returns, then revalidates on settle.
- Anonymous calls short-circuit at the screen-level (`if (!user) navigate('/login?next=...')`) so the hook never has to deal with unauthenticated state.

### Payment terminal overlay

The booking wizard's Confirm step opens a portal-mounted `<PaymentTerminal>` (centred fixed card with backdrop blur). It steps through three labelled stages on timers (`Authorising → Contacting bank → Approved`, with a UPI variant), then triggers the booking mutation. The mutation success handler advances the wizard to the confirmation step. Pay-at-hotel skips the terminal entirely.

### Reservation detail route

`/reservations/:id` is a dedicated screen for a single booking — hotel summary, dates, receipt, cancel button. The confirmation step's "View reservation" button and the profile's per-booking "View" button both push here. The backing endpoint `GET /api/bookings/:id` returns enough fields (hotel hero, address, phone, has_review) to render the page without a second hotel fetch.

### Forms

Every multi-field form (login, signup, profile, booking guest details, AddRooms wizard) uses `react-hook-form` with a Zod resolver. Schemas live in `lib/schemas.js` so the validation rules are shared between forms and the request payload shape.

### Theming

Two layers:

1. **Light / dark mode** — toggled via the `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`. CSS custom properties (`--bg`, `--ink`, `--accent`, …) re-resolve automatically. Initial value is set by an inline script in `index.html` so there's no flash of unstyled content.

2. **Accent palette** — five named presets (Terracotta / Forest / Ink / Saffron / Plum), each with separate values for light and dark modes. Picked via the floating Tweaks panel; `useTweaks(theme)` writes `--accent`, `--accent-soft`, and `--accent-ink` to the document root.

Both choices persist in `localStorage` (`nestoria-theme` and `nestoria-tweaks`).

### Auth flow

```
1.  User submits LoginScreen form
2.  authAPI.login({ role, email, password }) → POST /api/auth/login
3.  Backend returns { token, user }
4.  AuthContext.login(token, user) stores both in localStorage
5.  axios interceptor reads `nestoria-token` and adds Authorization header on every subsequent request
6.  ProtectedRoute checks AuthContext.user before rendering customer/host pages
7.  401 response → interceptor clears localStorage so the next render redirects to /login
```

Google sign-in skips steps 1–3 in favour of:

```
1.  GoogleLogin button (from @react-oauth/google) opens Google popup
2.  On success it returns a credential (Google ID token)
3.  authAPI.google({ role, credential }) → POST /api/auth/google
4.  Backend verifies the ID token against Google's JWKS via google-auth-library
5.  Backend either finds the user by google_sub, links Google to an existing email match, or creates a new account — then returns { token, user }
```

## Data flows

### Booking creation

```
1.  Customer clicks Reserve on DetailScreen
    → Navigate to /booking?room=…&hotel=…&checkin=…&checkout=…&guests=…
2.  BookingScreen step 0 collects guest details (react-hook-form)
3.  Step 1 collects payment details (currently mock)
4.  On Confirm → useMutation calls POST /api/bookings
5.  Backend opens a pg.connect() transaction:
       a. SELECT … FOR UPDATE on the row in `rooms` (prevents concurrent booking of the same room)
       b. EXISTS check for date overlap against `bookings` (excluding cancelled)
       c. INSERT into `bookings` with computed base/tax/total
       d. COMMIT
6.  Response → BookingScreen advances to step 2 (confirmation)
7.  TanStack Query invalidates `['bookings/my']` so ProfileScreen reflects the new row on next visit
```

### Review with rating recompute

```
1.  Customer posts a review (POST /api/reviews) for a completed booking
2.  Backend inserts into hotel_reviews and/or room_reviews
3.  AFTER INSERT trigger fires (002_triggers.sql):
       a. Compute COUNT + AVG(rating) over all reviews for that hotel/room
       b. Average sentiment from the most recent 100 (hotel) or 50 (room) reviews
       c. Bayesian smoothing toward global mean (3.8) with confidence weight 50/30
       d. Score = round((0.7 · normalised_rating + 0.3 · sentiment) · 100)
       e. UPDATE the parent row's rating_avg, rating_count, score
4.  Next time DetailScreen loads that hotel, the new numbers are returned in the join
```

### Web image upload

```
1.  Host on AddRoomsScreen clicks "Upload" hero image
2.  File is read into a FormData and POSTed to /api/upload/hotel-image
3.  multer fileFilter rejects anything that isn't JPEG/PNG/WebP
4.  Backend authenticates with the service-role key against Supabase Storage
5.  Object is written to `hotel-images/hotels/<timestamp>-<random>.<ext>`
6.  Backend returns the public URL
7.  Frontend immediately PUTs /api/hotels/:id with hero_image_url, so the hotel row records it
```

## Why these choices

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| Vite over Next.js | The app is SPA-first; SSR/SEO aren't requirements yet. Vite gives sub-second HMR, no server runtime, and trivial static hosting. |
| Plain CSS over Tailwind | The editorial aesthetic is heavy on type and white space, with a hand-tuned colour system in OKLCH. Tailwind utility classes would obscure that. CSS variables make light/dark and accent palettes trivial. |
| TanStack Query | Replaces hundreds of lines of `useEffect`/loading-state boilerplate from the previous codebase, and adds caching for free. |
| react-hook-form + Zod | One schema describes both the form validation and (effectively) the API contract. Zero-cost form re-renders. |
| google-auth-library over Firebase Admin | The previous backend pulled in the entire Firebase SDK just to verify Google ID tokens. `google-auth-library` does exactly that and nothing else. |
| Separate Customer / Host tables | Different columns (Hosts have GST, payout details, KYC, Superhost tier), different lifecycles. A unified Users table would require either many nullable columns or a JSON blob — both worse than two clean tables behind a generic repository. |
| Bayesian rating triggers in SQL | Rating computation is data-shape logic, not business logic. Keeping it in triggers means the application code (and any future analytics jobs) can trust `hotels.rating_avg` directly with no cache-coherence concerns. |
| Single Supabase bucket | All hotel and room images share `hotel-images` with public-read RLS. Easier than per-tenant buckets and the URLs aren't sensitive. |
